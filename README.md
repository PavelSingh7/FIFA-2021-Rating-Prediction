In this Project we will be analysing individual players abilities, skills and based on that will be looking for some insights.

# About the Dataset

The FIFA 2021 dataset consists of more than 17,000 active players around the world and more than 100 attributes for every player.
The dataset has been obtained online from Kaggle and is uncleaned and needs a lot of cleaning and preprocessing.
Among 107 attributes in the data, most of them are the skillsets of the players such as pace, jumping, attack, defence, speed, passing, shooting, dribbling etc. 
A few other attributes consist of Players information such as Name, country, club, contracts, photo, rating, potential etc.

There are a lot of attributes which are of no use during our analysis so during pre-processing we will be dropping them.

# OBJECTIVES FOR ANALYSIS

We will be working on a bunch of objectives for this project which will include data visualization and machine leaning models. 

## These are our objectives for this project:

•	  Top 5 highest rated players. 

•	  Which player has the highest potential in game?

•	  Top 5 players for every playing position.

•	  Team of the year according to every highest rated position.

•	  Most valuable player?

•	 Which players are highly valuable but still underpaid.

•	  Most preferred foot by players?

•	Longest stay in the Club

## Machine Leaning models objectives:

•	A regression model to predict rating based on skills of a player.

# Tools to be used for analysis:

•	Excel (Data understanding)

•	Python (Data preprocessing, ML models/Data Visualization)

•	Tableau (Data Visualization)
